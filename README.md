# hello-world

I write code for living...
The world is a huge collection of bits and pieces
that waits being put together.

Once these are put together,
they form an entity, which will have characteristics
of its own, and start changing its surroundings.

First thing it will do is
create a name for itself,
start looking for additional materials
that will make itself glorious,
i.e. start making lights itself...
